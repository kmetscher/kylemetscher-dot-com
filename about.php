        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>I'm Kyle Metscher, a student of Computer Science at Western Governors University and a service technician at Baker Road Automotive in Stevenson, Washington. More casually, I study linguistics, music, history, and art.</p>
        <h2>What is this website for?</h2>
        <p>This site primarily serves as a blog where I will post about vehicles I work on at the shop, mostly in a lessons-learned repair guide format. I will also post music and movie reviews, and updates about my personal projects, including work I do on the site itself. My intent is for it to become a living portfolio for colleagues, prospective employers, and those interested in collaborating to see what I'm up to.</p>
        <h2>How does this site work?</h2>
        <p>I wrote and styled this site in HTML and CSS as a form of study for a web development course at Western Governors University. The site runs on an Apache installation on an AWS EC2 instance with a backend I wrote in PHP and mySQL. It is a perennial work in progress.</p><br>
        <p>On the home page, the ten most recent posts appear as previews in publishing order. On the right-hand side of the page, a list of tags used to file posts under are in a scrollable list. As time goes on, posts made in a given month will appear under their respective entries in the archives. You can also filter posts by language.</p>

        <h2>What credentials do you hold?</h2>
        <p>I graduated with an Associate of Arts in general studies from Clark College in Vancouver, Washington, where I enrolled at 16 years old and received my degree at 18 as part of Washington State's "Running Start" program. I am a small motors technician. I am actively pursuing my Project+ and ITIL Foundation certifications.</p>
        <h2>What work experience do you have?</h2>
        <p>I have been a copy editor and writer, translator, conference volunteer, traveling salesman, fry cook, business owner, internet marketer, front-end web designer, warehouse and airport freight handler, barista, automotive technician, and delivery boy. References are available upon request.</p>
        <h2>What programming languages do you have experience with?</h2>
        <p>C/C++, PHP, Python, Rust, Ruby, Lua, JavaScript, and for a more liberal definition, HTML and CSS. The list is certain to grow.</p>

        <h2>Beszél magyarul?</h2>
        <p>Igen! Budapesten éltem két évet. Sajnos nem olyan szépen beszélek mint igazi magyar, de kiprobálom mindenesetre.</p>
        <h2>Van-e kedve, Magyarországra visszajönni?</h2>
        <p>Természetesen igen. Ha Önnek van valamilyen információja vagy munkája nekem, kérlek, nézz a <a href="#">kapcsolati oldalt</a>.</p>
