1	I've noticed that your reddit avatar is not wearing a hijab	Some body text	Sister. I've noticed that your reddit avatar is not wearing a hijab. When you wear a hijab, you are obeying the commands of Allah, and you can expect great rewards in return. It is Allah's protection of your natural beauty. You are too precious to be "on display" for each man to see. It is Allah's preservation of your chastity. Allah purifies your heart and mind through the hijab. Allah raises your dignity through the hijab. When a strange man looks at you, he respects you because he sees that you respect yourself. And this applies to your reddit avatar as well.	https://cdn.memes.com/profilebackgroundpics/95406421590382807/image/4111591575101.jpeg	1969-04-20	en
