# kylemetscher-dot-com

Contains the HTML, style sheets, and server-side files needed for my personal website. The site will be a blog where I upload posts about vehicles I work
on at my current job, movie and music reviews, random thoughts, and updates on the site itself and other projects.

The website is currently in infancy. My plan is to run it on an EC2 instance with Apache installed, using PHP to dynamically generate pages for individual
posts and preview objects on the site home page as I upload posts. This is my first true foray into web development.

Test posts adapted from r/copypasta.
