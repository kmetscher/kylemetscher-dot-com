# kylemetscher-dot-com

Contains the HTML, style sheets, and server-side files needed for my personal website. The site will be a blog where I upload posts about vehicles I work
on at my current job, movie and music reviews, random thoughts, and updates on the site itself and other projects.

Test posts adapted from r/copypasta.

Originally set out with object-oriented paradigm in mind, abandoned in favor of functional-procedural.

Current challenges:

Smooth sailing atm~

Future plans:

Moving to PDO for fetches.
Writing postview.php page so people can actually read posts.
Scripting the top header to become a slow slideshow of other photographs I've taken.
Sorting posts by tags via tagview.php page.
Sorting posts by month via archiveview.php page and archive sidebar.
Making contact page actually do something.
Allowing a user to switch the entire interface to their language via the language sidebar option.
Functionalize PHP procedures and utilize scripts folder
Evaluate possibility of object-oriented paradigm
Host on Amazon EC2 instance with LAMP stack
